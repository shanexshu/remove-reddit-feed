# Remove Reddit Homepage
Chrome extension for removing distracting Reddit homepage

### What does it do?
This project hides the Reddit homepage, so you won't be tempted to mindlessly scroll for hours. But rather than blocking the whole site, you will still have access to individual posts that you find from searching a question on Google, for example.
